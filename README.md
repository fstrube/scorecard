# About Scorecard

The Scorecard is a rubric for evaluating the quality of a web project. The checklist calculates a score for your project, and aims to determine if certain areas need more attention.

The intended use of this list is to provide a quick way to assess the quality of a web project (without having to dive into code).

In a lot of ways it is like ["The Joel Test"](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html). In fact, some items in the list come directly from Joel's. However, this list is more geared towards our web development projects, whereas The Joel Test evaluates a team of developers.

## Wait. There's more.

Although it is intended to grade web development projects, the Scorecard can be tweaked and modified to grade anything. Job interviews, exams, health â€” if you can think it, you can score it.
