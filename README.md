About Scorecard
=========

The Scorecard is a rubric for evaluating the quality of a web project. The checklist calculates a score for your project, and aims to determine if certain areas need more attention.

The intended use of this list is to provide a quick way to assess the quality of a web project (without having to dive into code).

In a lot of ways it is like "The Joel Test". In fact, some items in the list come directly from Joel's. However, this list is more geared towards our web development projects, whereas The Joel Test evaluates a team of developers.

Wait. There's more.

Although it is intended to grade web development projects, the Scorecard can be tweaked and modified to grade anything.
